# babel-plugin-module-mixin
- plugin to add support for ruby-like module syntax

# Todo
- add babel as git submodule (or whatever that accomplishes)
- create dedicated branch on babel to add work (or not if unnecessary)
- lexing
- parsing
- implement plugin
  - need to do some research on how can prototype be used for this
